# Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Blackbox Exporter Setup

This repository provides a complete setup for monitoring external services using **Prometheus**, **Alertmanager**, and **Blackbox Exporter**. It is designed to track the availability and performance of web services (HTTP/HTTPS endpoints) and alert on any issues such as downtime or degraded response times.

## Components

### 1. Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system. It scrapes metrics from defined targets and stores them in a time-series database. This setup configures Prometheus to collect metrics from the Blackbox Exporter.

### 2. Alertmanager
Alertmanager handles alerts generated by Prometheus. It manages alert routing, deduplication, and notifications. This setup ensures that when an endpoint goes down or has performance issues, the relevant team members are notified via the configured notification channels.

### 3. Blackbox Exporter
The Blackbox Exporter probes endpoints over multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP). It checks whether services are reachable and records their response times. This repository focuses on monitoring HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, but it can be extended to other protocols as needed.

## Use Case
This setup is ideal for monitoring websites, APIs, or any web services where uptime and performance are critical. The system can:
- Monitor availability by sending HTTP/HTTPS probes to specified endpoints.
- Trigger alerts if endpoints are unreachable or if response times exceed a threshold.
- Route alerts through Alertmanager to notify relevant stakeholders via email, Slack, or other channels.
